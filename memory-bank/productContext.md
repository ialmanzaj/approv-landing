# Product Context: Magnific Landing Page

## 1. Problem Space
Managing approval workflows (e.g., maintenance requests, budget approvals, supplier onboarding) can be slow, inefficient, and lack proper audit trails. Traditional methods involving emails, spreadsheets, or manual follow-ups often lead to delays, bottlenecks, and difficulty in tracking progress and compliance.

## 2. Solution: Magnific
Magnific aims to solve these problems by providing a streamlined, automated workflow solution, primarily leveraging WhatsApp for communication and approvals. It allows users to:
- Initiate requests easily (via WhatsApp, email, or templates).
- Have managers and relevant parties review and approve requests with auditable trails.
- Receive automatic notifications and maintain comprehensive audit logs for every decision.

The landing page serves as the initial point of contact to introduce Magnific, explain its benefits, and encourage potential customers to request a demo to learn more.

## 3. How It Should Work (Landing Page)
- **Information Delivery:** The page should clearly and concisely present what Magnific is, how it works (e.g., the 3-step process: Send, Review & Approve, Complete & Log), and its key features (e.g., WhatsApp Gateway, Audit Trails, Custom Workflows).
- **Value Proposition:** It must emphasize the core benefits: reducing approval times from days to minutes, simplifying compliance, and providing a centralized platform for managing these processes.
- **Call to Action:** The primary goal is to drive demo requests. CTA buttons ("Solicita una demo", "Reserva una demo") should be prominent and easily accessible.
- **Trust Building:** Testimonials from existing users help build credibility and showcase real-world benefits.
- **Objection Handling:** An FAQ section addresses common questions and concerns upfront.

## 4. User Experience (UX) Goals
- **Clarity:** The messaging should be easy to understand, even for users not deeply technical.
- **Engagement:** The design should be visually appealing, modern, and keep users engaged as they scroll through the information.
- **Ease of Navigation:** Users should be able to find information quickly and understand the flow of the page.
- **Responsiveness:** The page must provide an optimal viewing experience across various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **Trustworthiness:** The design and content should convey professionalism and reliability.
