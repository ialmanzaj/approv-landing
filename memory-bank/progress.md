# Progress: Magnific Landing Page

## 1. What Works / Implemented Features
Based on the analysis of `src/App.tsx` and other files:

- **Core Landing Page Structure:** A full single-page layout is implemented with distinct sections:
    - Header with branding and "Solicita una demo" CTA.
    - Hero section with headline, sub-headline, and "Reserva una demo" CTA.
    - Feature grid showcasing key product aspects (using placeholder icons).
    - "How it Works" section detailing a 3-step process.
    - Testimonial grid with sample testimonials (using `randomuser.me` for avatars).
    - FAQ section implemented with a functional accordion (`components/ui/accordion.tsx`).
    - Footer with branding and placeholder links for Privacy Policy & Terms of Service.
- **Styling:** The page is styled using Tailwind CSS, including custom font (`PP Mori`) and a defined color scheme.
- **Responsiveness:** Tailwind CSS classes suggest efforts towards a responsive design, though this would need to be verified by testing.
- **Componentization:** Basic component structure is in place (e.g., `App.tsx`, `accordion.tsx`, `PlaceholderIcon`).
- **Build Setup:** The project is set up to be built with Vite and uses TypeScript.
- **Utility Functions:** A `cn` utility for classname management is implemented.

## 2. What's Left to Build / Improve
- **Functional Demo Booking:** The `#demo` links are likely placeholders. Actual integration for booking demos is needed.
- **Final Assets:**
    - Replace placeholder SVG icons in the Feature Grid with actual icons.
    - Replace `randomuser.me` testimonial avatars with real ones.
- **Content Finalization:** Review and finalize all text content (currently in Spanish).
- **Analytics Integration:** Implement tracking for user interactions, CTA clicks, page views, etc.
- **Image Optimization:** Ensure all images (if any beyond avatars are added) are optimized for web performance.
- **Comprehensive Accessibility (A11y) Audit & Enhancements:** While Radix UI helps, a full review is needed.
- **Cross-Browser Testing:** Thoroughly test across different browsers and devices.
- **SEO Optimization:** Implement meta tags, structured data, etc.
- **Link Finalization:** Ensure footer links (Privacy Policy, Terms) point to actual pages.
- **Error Handling:** While `main.tsx` has a root element check, more robust error boundaries could be considered for React components.
- **Code Comments/Documentation:** Add more comments where necessary for clarity, especially for complex logic if any is added.

## 3. Current Status
- The landing page frontend is largely complete in terms of structure and basic presentation based on the provided `src`.
- It serves as a good visual and informational presentation of the "Magnific" product.
- The immediate next steps would involve replacing placeholder content and implementing functional CTAs/integrations.
- Memory Bank has just been initialized for this project.

## 4. Known Issues / Blockers (from initial scan)
- **Placeholder Content:** As noted above (icons, avatars, potentially some text if not final).
- **Non-Functional CTAs:** Demo links go to `#demo`.
- **Missing `public` assets information:** The exact location and availability of the `PPMori-Regular.woff2` font file is assumed.
- **No backend context:** Any backend dependencies or integrations for demo requests are unknown from the `src` files.
