# Active Context: Magnific Landing Page

## 1. Current Focus
- **Initialization of Memory Bank:** The primary activity is to establish the baseline documentation for the Magnific Landing Page project.
- **Understanding Existing Codebase:** Analyzing the provided `src` directory to infer project structure, technologies, and purpose.

## 2. Recent Changes
- This is the initial setup of the Memory Bank. No prior changes within this tracking system exist.
- The project itself (Magnific Landing Page) appears to be a relatively complete, single-page application, based on the content of `App.tsx`.

## 3. Next Steps (General Project)
- **Review and Refine Memory Bank:** Verify the accuracy and completeness of the newly created Memory Bank files.
- **Identify Areas for Improvement:** Based on the initial analysis, potential next steps for the codebase itself could include:
    - Adding actual demo booking functionality if `#demo` links are placeholders.
    - Image optimization for performance.
    - Implementing analytics (e.g., for tracking CTA clicks).
    - Enhancing accessibility beyond default Radix UI provisions.
    - Adding internationalization/localization if the product targets a broader audience.
- **Address any TODOs or placeholders:** (e.g., placeholder SVG icons, dummy testimonial avatars if not final).

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations
- **Technology Stack Identification:** Confirmed React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and likely shadcn/ui.
- **Project Purpose:** Identified as a landing page for a workflow automation tool called Magnific.
- **Content Language:** The current content is in Spanish.

## 5. Open Questions/Assumptions
- **Font File Location:** Assumed `PPMori-Regular.woff2` is located in a `public/fonts/` directory, as is standard for Vite projects.
- **Demo Link Functionality:** Assumed `#demo` links are placeholders and do not currently lead to a functional demo booking system.
- **Image Sources:** Testimonial avatars are from `randomuser.me`, likely placeholders.
- **Completeness of `src`:** Assumed the provided `src` directory represents the core frontend of the landing page.
- **Backend:** No backend specific to this landing page is apparent from the provided files. Any demo request processing would happen elsewhere or is not yet implemented.
